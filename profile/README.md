Indieops Inc. is an organization/movement dedicated to providing devops and workflow streaming solutions targeted at individual developers in organizations where developers streamlining workflow is politically dangerous or pragmatically impossible.

Our tools, technologies, and techniques are designed to work at the individual developer level and not require approval from an organization to install or a PR approved from a lead to set up.

We are Indieops. We leave no trace.
